# kv3
kv3 is a free software version and rewrite of the classic ``Kaso Verb Conjugation System'' Adolfo, C & Olesen, M (2005) ``Kaso Verb Conjugation System'' Boston MA Branden Books.

Mr. Caso created a database system in spreadsheet form whereby verbs can be conjugated. Although the database has changed over the years, the systematic approach remains the same. That is, the logic has not changed. 

kv3 database system can be applied to most western languages. However, the current state of the database is three (3) languages: (1) English, (2) Spanish and (3) Italian.
