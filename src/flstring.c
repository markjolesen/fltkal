 * The FLTK library and included programs are provided under the terms

 * exceptions:
 * 
 *     1. Modifications to the FLTK configure script, config
 *        header file, and makefiles by themselves to support
 *        a specific platform do not constitute a modified or
 *        derivative work.
 * 
 *       The authors do request that such modifications be
 *       contributed to the FLTK project - send all contributions
 *       through the "Software Trouble Report" on the following page:
 *  
 *            http://www.fltk.org/str.php
 * 
 *     2. Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do not
 *        constitute a derivative work.
 * 
 *     3. Static linking of applications and widgets to the
 *        FLTK library does not constitute a derivative work
 *        and does not require the author to provide source
 *        code for the application or widget, use the shared
 *        FLTK libraries, or link their applications or
 *        widgets against a user-supplied version of FLTK.
 * 
 *        If you link the application or widget to a modified
 *        version of FLTK, then the changes to FLTK must be
 *        provided under the terms of the LGPL in sections
 *        1, 2, and 4.
 * 
 *     4. You do not have to provide a copy of the FLTK license
 *        with programs that are linked to the FLTK library, nor
 *        do you have to identify the FLTK license in your
 *        program or documentation as required by section 6
 *        of the LGPL.
 * 
 *        However, programs must still identify their use of FLTK.
 *        The following example statement can be included in user
 *        documentation to satisfy this requirement:
 * 
 *            [program/widget] is based in part on the work of
 *            the FLTK project (http://www.fltk.org).
