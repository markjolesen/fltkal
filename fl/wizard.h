// 
//     1. Modifications to the FLTK configure script, config

//        a specific platform do not constitute a modified or
//        derivative work.
// 
//       The authors do request that such modifications be
//       contributed to the FLTK project - send all contributions
//       through the "Software Trouble Report" on the following page:
//  
//            http://www.fltk.org/str.php
// 
//     2. Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do not
//        constitute a derivative work.
// 
//     3. Static linking of applications and widgets to the
//        FLTK library does not constitute a derivative work
//        and does not require the author to provide source
//        code for the application or widget, use the shared
//        FLTK libraries, or link their applications or
//        widgets against a user-supplied version of FLTK.
// 
//        If you link the application or widget to a modified
//        version of FLTK, then the changes to FLTK must be
//        provided under the terms of the LGPL in sections
//        1, 2, and 4.
// 
//     4. You do not have to provide a copy of the FLTK license
//        with programs that are linked to the FLTK library, nor
//        do you have to identify the FLTK license in your
//        program or documentation as required by section 6
//        of the LGPL.
// 
//        However, programs must still identify their use of FLTK.
//        The following example statement can be included in user
//        documentation to satisfy this requirement:
// 
//            [program/widget] is based in part on the work of
//            the FLTK project (http://www.fltk.org).

/**
    This widget is based off the Fl_Tabs
    widget, but instead of displaying tabs it only changes "tabs" under
    program control. Its primary purpose is to support "wizards" that
    step a user through configuration or troubleshooting tasks.

    <P>As with Fl_Tabs, wizard panes are composed of child (usually
    Fl_Group) widgets. Navigation buttons must be added separately.
