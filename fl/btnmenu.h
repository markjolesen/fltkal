/**
  This is a button that when pushed pops up a menu (or hierarchy of
  menus) defined by an array of 
  Fl_Menu_Item objects.
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>\image html  menu_button.png</P>
  \image latex  menu_button.png " menu_button" width=5cm
  <P>Normally any mouse button will pop up a menu and it is lined up
  below the button as shown in the picture.  However an Fl_Menu_Button
  may also control a pop-up menu.  This is done by setting the type().
  If type() is zero a normal menu button is produced. 
  If it is nonzero then this is a pop-up menu. The bits in type() indicate 
  what mouse buttons pop up the menu (see Fl_Menu_Button::popup_buttons). </P>
  <P>The menu will also pop up in response to shortcuts indicated by
  putting a '&' character in the label(). </P>
  <P>Typing the shortcut() of any of the menu items will cause
  callbacks exactly the same as when you pick the item with the mouse.
  The '&' character in menu item names are only looked at when the menu is
  popped up, however. </P>

  When the user clicks a menu item, value() is set to that item
  and then:

      - The item's callback is done if one has been set; the
        Fl_Menu_Button is passed as the Fl_Widget* argument, 
        along with any userdata configured for the callback.

      - If the item does not have a callback, the Fl_Menu_Button's callback
        is done instead, along with any userdata configured for it.
        The callback can determine which item was picked using
        value(), mvalue(), item_pathname(), etc.
