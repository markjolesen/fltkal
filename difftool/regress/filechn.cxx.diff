+//     1. Modifications to the FLTK configure script, config

+//        a specific platform do not constitute a modified or

+// 
+//       The authors do request that such modifications be
+//       contributed to the FLTK project - send all contributions
+//       through the "Software Trouble Report" on the following page:
 //
 //     http://www.fltk.org/str.php
 //
+//     2. Widgets that are subclassed from FLTK widgets do not
+//        constitute a derivative work.
+// 
+//     3. Static linking of applications and widgets to the
+//        FLTK library does not constitute a derivative work
+//        and does not require the author to provide source
+//        code for the application or widget, use the shared
+//        FLTK libraries, or link their applications or
+//        widgets against a user-supplied version of FLTK.
+// 
+//        If you link the application or widget to a modified
+//        version of FLTK, then the changes to FLTK must be
+//        provided under the terms of the LGPL in sections
+//        1, 2, and 4.
+// 
+//     4. You do not have to provide a copy of the FLTK license
+//        with programs that are linked to the FLTK library, nor
+//        do you have to identify the FLTK license in your
+//        program or documentation as required by section 6
+//        of the LGPL.
+// 
+//        However, programs must still identify their use of FLTK.
+//        The following example statement can be included in user
+//        documentation to satisfy this requirement:
+// 
+//            [program/widget] is based in part on the work of
+//            the FLTK project (http://www.fltk.org).
