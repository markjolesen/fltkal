# The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
# It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
# The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
# ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
# but is also freely distributable.
# 
# The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
# To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
# support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
# to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
# algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
# by all standard GIF decoders.
#
