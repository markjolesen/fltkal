 *
 * This file contains application interface code for the decompression half
 * of the JPEG library.  These are the "standard" API routines that are
 * used in the normal full-decompression case.  They are not used by a
 * transcoding-only application.  Note that if an application links in
 * jpeg_start_decompress, it will end up linking in the entire decompressor.
 * We thus must separate this file from jdapimin.c to avoid linking the
 * whole decompression library into a transcoder.
