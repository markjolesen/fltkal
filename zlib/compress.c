     Compresses the source buffer into the destination buffer. The level
   parameter has the same meaning as in deflateInit.  sourceLen is the byte
   length of the source buffer. Upon entry, destLen is the total size of the
   destination buffer, which must be at least 0.1% larger than sourceLen plus
   12 bytes. Upon exit, destLen is the actual size of the compressed buffer.

     compress2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_BUF_ERROR if there was not enough room in the output buffer,
   Z_STREAM_ERROR if the level parameter is invalid.
