# fltkal

fltkal is a DOS fork of the Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK) using Allegro4 and DJGPP.
The fork required renaming files to 8.3 conventions. Other than that, however,
the API is compatible with the 1.4.x branch.

API Documentation can be found on the [FLTK web site](http://fltk.org/doc-1.4/)

A demo of a couple of example apps running on FreeDOS can be found here
